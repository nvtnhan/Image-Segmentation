This notebook presents the following tasks:

1. **Mass Segmentation** – Image processing for identifying mass regions, typically in medical imaging.
2. **Dataset Construction** – Creating a table containing two classes: *fresh* and *rotten* oranges.
3. **Machine Learning Classification** – Applying a machine learning algorithm to learn and classify between fresh and rotten oranges.

The notebook combines image segmentation and supervised machine learning to address a real-world classification task.
