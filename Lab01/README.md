This notebook demonstrates and implements two image thresholding techniques:

1. **Global Thresholding**
2. **Local Thresholding**

With specific applications in:
- **Iris Segmentation**
- **Bone Segmentation**

These image processing techniques are used to extract meaningful information from medical images, serving as foundational tasks in computer vision and medical image analysis.
